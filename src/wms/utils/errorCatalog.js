// Mirror of api/services/webhook_dispatcher/error_catalog.py for the
// places in the admin UI that need to render description / triage_hint
// without a server round-trip (notably the per-subscription DLQ viewer,
// whose endpoint has not been extended to return catalog fields).
//
// The cross-subscription /admin/webhook-errors endpoint joins the
// server catalog at response time and ships description + triage_hint
// per row, so it does NOT consult this mirror.
//
// Keep in sync with the python module. Adding a new error_kind there
// without updating here lands a "(no description)" placeholder in the
// DLQ tooltip, which is operator-visible but harmless.
